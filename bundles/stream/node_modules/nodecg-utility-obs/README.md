# nodecg-utility-obs [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nodecg-obs.svg)](https://npm.im/nodecg-obs)

[`nodecg-utility-obs`](https://github.com/NodeCG/nodecg-obs/packages/nodecg-utility-obs) is a NodeCG utility that adds a set of Replicants, Messages, and other hooks to your NodeCG bundle. It is meant for use with NodeCG v0.9. You can think of it like a mixin for your NodeCG bundle.

It requires that the instance of OBS have [`obs-websocket`](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket) installed and configured.

Internally, it uses [`obs-websocket-js`](https://github.com/haganbmj/obs-websocket-js) to communicate with `obs-websocket`.

## Install

`$ npm install --save nodecg-utility-obs`
